# Get started with ExoClick ads for React
`@exo-click/react` is a library to use ExoClick's ads in [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react). It is designed to
be easy to use and very light.

You can try each ad type right here on the component's playgrounds. To go to production, you'll need a publisher account
with ExoClick. You can [register here](https://www.exoclick.com/signup/?login=tomhooijenga).

## Install
```bash
npm install @exo-click/react
```
```bash
yarn add @exo-click/react
```

## Use
```jsx
import { Banner } from "@exo-click/react";

<Banner zoneId={123} />
```
That's it!
