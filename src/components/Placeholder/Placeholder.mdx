# Placeholder
A helper component that has a fixed size. It creates a wrapper of the given width and height. This is done to reduce
[layout shift](https://web.dev/cls/).

## Banners
Use it with [ExoClick banners](/src-components-banner-banner). This approach ensures that the browser can allocate the
correct amount of space in the document while the banner is loading.

<Playground>
  <Placeholder width="728" height="90">
    <Banner zoneId="2921652" />
  </Placeholder>
</Playground>

## Outstream video
Use it with [ExoClick outstream](/src-components-outstream-outstream) to prevent the slide-down effect from moving the
content of the page.

<Playground>
  <Placeholder width="400" height="266">
    <Outstream zoneId="4176664" maxWidth={400} />
  </Placeholder>
</Playground>



## Props

<Props of={Placeholder} />
