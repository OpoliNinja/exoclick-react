## Regular (Web)

Classic Full Page Interstitial: horizontal. Opens on internal link and can be closed by viewer. It can be triggered once
per zone.

This type does not open if the screen is higher than it is tall, i.e., most mobile phones.

<Playground>
  <a href="#" onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()} className="demo-desktop">Click me</a>
  <FullpageInterstitial zoneId={4318792} frequencyType="clicks" firstTriggerClicks={1} nextTriggerClicks={1} triggerClass={['demo-desktop']} />
</Playground>

## Mobile

Mobile Full Page Interstitial: Opens on internal link and closed by viewer. Unlike the desktop variant, the mobile version
has no restrictions on the screen ratio.

<Playground>
  <a href="#" onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()} className="demo-mobile">Click me</a>
  <FullpageInterstitial zoneId={4318840} frequencyType="clicks" firstTriggerClicks={1} nextTriggerClicks={1} triggerClass={['demo-mobile']} />
